All content is encrypted at time of download, and decrypted on the fly as the user reads, including HTML5 video content. The platform also included a verbose library screen for all of the user's owned content, and an in-app store where they can buy more. This project, via Gradle flavors and flexible coding, became the basis for 5 published applications on the Google Play store, the most prominent being WORDsearch Bible (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lifeway.wordsearchreader) with over 20,000 unique users and over 30,000 total installations."

The goal was to implement behavior learning of user action. After one week of typical usage, the device would be able to recognize the user based upon hardware sensor readings, and determine if the current user is the owner of the device. If the protocol detected otherwise, other security mechanisms would take effect, such as confirmation of device password, or answering a security question."
